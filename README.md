# Spaceship

## Story

Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has numerous launches
nowadays that need a lot of astronauts to be trained. They decided to have
their own training center and simulator, so now it's your job to create a
prototype of a simulator which prepares astronauts for various situations.

## What are you going to learn?

- Create programs in the Scratch visual programming environment.
- Understand the basic building blocks of a program: statements, loops, conditions and variables.
- Group statements into logical building blocks which help you understand the concept of functions later.
- Assemble a program with which the user can interact via keyboard.

## Tasks

1. Create a program where you can move a spaceship with the left and right arrows.
    - Pressing the left key (even constantly) moves the spaceship to the left on the screen.
    - Pressing the right key (even constantly) moves the spaceship to the right on the screen.
    - The spaceship does not move out of the screen.

2. Asteroids and stars come from the top.
    - Asteroids show up at the top, move continously down and disappear at the bottom.
    - At least two asteroids and one star fall down with different properties (such as color, speed, rolling direction).

3. The program handles collisions between the spaceship and the asteroids, as well as the spaceship avoiding the asteroids.
    - If the spaceship touches an asteroid, the asteroid disappears.
    - When the asteroid reaches the bottom of the screen without touching the spaceship, the user gets a point.

4. If the user catches a star they receive a simple question and get additional points if the answer is correct.
    - If the spaceship touches a star, a random question appears.
    - If the user answers the question correctly, they get a point.
    - After answering the question the star disappears.
    - The spaceship sprite stores answers and questions in lists.
    - There are at least 3 question-answer pairs used in the program.

5. [OPTIONAL] Extend the program with additional features (shooting, lives, sound effects etc.).
    - The spaceship can shoot and destroy asteroids.
    - The user has lives and the number of lives decreases when colliding with asteroids.
    - The program includes sound effects (e.g. shooting, collisions).
    - There is another extra feature \#1 implemented.
    - There is another extra feature \#2 implemented.
    - There is another extra feature \#3 implemented.
